        Iâ€™m a seasoned sales, marketing, and media professional based in
        Toronto, Canada, with over five years of experience in lead generation,
        B2B and B2C sales and marketing, videography, video editing, and
        comprehensive social media content strategy and execution. Passionate
        about purpose-driven content creation, I seamlessly merge creativity
        with data to achieve impactful results. <br />
        <br />
        Originally from Manila, I have honed my storytelling skills through
        various roles in tech startup sales and marketing. Currently, I am
        pursuing postgraduate studies in broadcasting at Seneca College,
        Toronto, building on my bachelor`s degree in Marketing Management. My
        proficiency in camera work, video editing, scriptwriting, and content
        creation fuels my ambition to further develop my marketing expertise and
        become a prominent content creator in the tech media industry. <br />
        <br />
        Outside of my professional pursuits, I enjoy traveling, cooking,
        exploring films, and indulging in fashion.
